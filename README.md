# How to Run Streamlit Dashboard

This is a brief guide to running the Streamlit dashboard. Make sure you have installed all the required libraries before running the application. You can ignore the ipynb file because I only used it for comprehensive data cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) before creating the data dashboard.

## Install Dependencies

To install all the required libraries, open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to this project folder, and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Dashboard
```bash
cd dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
